# Research Paper Analyzer

A sophisticated research paper analysis system powered by [CrewAI](https://crewai.com) and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) that analyzes academic papers and generates comprehensive reports with executive summaries, key insights, and actionable recommendations.

## Overview

The Research Paper Analyzer uses a team of specialized AI agents to analyze academic papers through several phases:

1. **Technical Analysis**: Detailed examination of methodology, statistical approaches, and results
2. **Literature Review**: Contextualization within the broader academic landscape
3. **Summary Creation**: Synthesis of key findings and contributions
4. **Final Report Generation**: Comprehensive report with insights and recommendations

### High-Level Architecture

The system operates through four specialized agents:

- **Research Director**: Coordinates analysis and ensures quality
- **Technical Expert**: Analyzes methodologies and statistical significance
- **Literature Specialist**: Reviews research context and connections
- **Summary Writer**: Creates clear, accessible summaries

## Installation

### Prerequisites
