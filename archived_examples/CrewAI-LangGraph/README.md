## CrewAI Framework
CrewAI is designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-playing AI agents. In this example, these agents work together to give a complete stock analysis and investment recommendation

## Running the Code
This example uses GPT-4.

- **Configure Environment**: Copy ``.env.example` and set up the environment variable

- **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Execute the Script**: Run `python main.py`

## Details & Explanation
- **Running the Script**: Execute `python main.py`
