#### Workflow Management

Use CrewAI's workflow management features to sequence tasks and ensure smooth execution. This includes setting up triggers and conditions for task execution.

## Real-World Example: Automating Email Responses

To demonstrate the power of CrewAI, let's walk through a real-world example of automating email responses. This example will cover reading emails, categorizing them, generating responses, and sending the responses.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Reading Emails:** The AI agent reads incoming emails and categorizes them based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., urgency, subject matter).
2. **Generating Responses:** The agent uses templates and machine learning models to generate appropriate responses.
3. **Sending Emails:** The agent sends the generated responses to the respective recipients.

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Reading Emails

You need to access your email inbox to read incoming emails. Here’s a basic example of how to use an email library like `imaplib` to read emails:

```python
import imaplib
import email

# Connect to the server
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')

# Login to your account
mail.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')

# Select the mailbox you want to check
mail.select('inbox')

# Search for all emails in the inbox
status, messages = mail.search(None, 'ALL')

# Convert messages to a list of email IDs
email_ids = messages[0].split()

# Fetch the latest email
status, msg_data = mail.fetch(email_ids[-1], '(RFC822)')

# Parse the email content
msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])

# Print the subject of the email
print(msg['subject'])
```

#### Step 2: Categorizing Emails

Next, categorize the emails using CrewAI’s natural language processing capabilities. For simplicity, let’s assume you are categorizing emails into "urgent," "normal," and "spam."

```python
from crewai import CrewAI

# Initialize CrewAI
crew = CrewAI(api_key='your-crewai-api-key')

def categorize_email(subject):
    response = crew.classify_text(subject)
    return response['category']

subject = msg['subject']
category = categorize_email(subject)
print(f"Email Category: {category}")
```

#### Step 3: Generating Responses

Once the email is categorized, you can generate an appropriate response. CrewAI can assist in generating context-specific responses.

```python
def generate_response(category):
    if category == 'urgent':
        response = "Thank you for your urgent email. We will get back to you shortly."
    elif category == 'normal':
        response = "Thank you for your email. We will respond at our earliest convenience."
    elif category == 'spam':
        response = "This email has been marked as spam."
    else:
        response = "Thank you for your email."
    return response

response_text = generate_response(category)
print(f"Generated Response: {response_text}")
```

#### Step 4: Sending Responses

Finally, send the generated response back to the sender using an email sending library like `smtplib`.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_response(to_email, subject, body):
    # Setup the MIME
    message = MIMEText(body, 'plain')
    message['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
    message['To'] = to_email
    message['Subject'] = f"Re: {subject}"

    # Use the SMTP server to send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')
    server.sendmail('your-email@gmail.com', to_email, message.as_string())
    server.quit()

send_email_response(msg['from'], msg['subject'], response_text)
```

This example covers the basic workflow of reading an email, categorizing it, generating a response, and sending it back to the sender using CrewAI.

**Note:** For a production environment, you should use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive information like email credentials and API keys. Additionally, you can leverage advanced CrewAI functionalities and libraries to handle more complex scenarios and improve the accuracy of email categorization and response generation.
