I am just attempting to clean up the examples here and update them to the current standard:

I Am Currently Working On: game_builder_crew

Then In This Order:
job_posting
prep_for_a_meeting
stock_analysis
trip_planner

I Do Not Plan On Doing the following:
starter_template (not needed now use 'crewai create')
azure_model
markdown_validator
screenplay_writer

These Are Still Op For Debate:
CrewAI-LangGraph  (maybe later)
landing_page_generator (maybe later)
