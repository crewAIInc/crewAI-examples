'''
Example script to automatically write a screenplay from a newsgroup post using agents with Crew.ai (https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI)
You can also try it out with a personal email with many replies back and forth and see it turn into a movie script.
Demonstrates:
- multiple API endpoints (offical Mistral, Together.ai, Anyscale)
- running single tasks: spam detection and scoring
- running a crew to create a screenplay from a newsgroup post by first analyzing the text, creating a dialogue and ultimately formatting it
Additional endpoints requirements:
  pip install langchain_mistralai
  pip install langchain-together

  Clarity: How clear is the exchange? Are the statements and responses easy to understand?
  Relevance: Do the responses stay on topic and contribute to the conversation's purpose?
  Conciseness: Is the dialogue free of unnecessary information or redundancy?
  Politeness: Are the participants respectful and considerate in their interaction?
  Engagement: Do the participants seem interested and actively involved in the dialogue?
  Flow: Is there a natural progression of ideas and responses? Are there awkward pauses or interruptions?
  Coherence: Does the dialogue make logical sense as a whole?
  Responsiveness: Do the participants address each other's points adequately?
  Language Use: Is the grammar, vocabulary, and syntax appropriate for the context of the dialogue?
  Emotional Intelligence: Are the participants aware of and sensitive to the emotional tone of the dialogue?

Are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?
Anyway, I think that "revenge" or "fairness" is why most people are in
favor of the punishment.  If a murderer is going to be punished, people
that think that he should "get what he deserves."  Most people wouldn't
think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.

>Revenge?  Petty and pathetic.

Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the
minority.

>did a segment on capital punishment.  Each and every advocate of

Where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  If
someone wrongs me, I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone kills
another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.
Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?

Or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should
never be violated?  This would sound like some sort of religious view.

Once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.

And, you still have not answered my question.  If you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,
then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment.  Shouldn't we,
by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?
