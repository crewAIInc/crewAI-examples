Meet NeuroFlow
Our Story
NeuroFlow CEO and West Point graduate Christopher Molaro served in the army for five years, including a tour in Iraq as a platoon leader. Coming back home, he experienced firsthand the gaps in the behavioral health system and how veterans and civilians alike face too many barriers when it comes to receiving appropriate, timely care.
While pursuing his MBA at Wharton, Chris met his future co-founder Adam Pardes, and the two agreed – even the most engaging digital mental health apps in the world wouldn’t truly change the problem; only a solution that systematically integrated behavioral health into the full healthcare ecosystem could create meaningful change. And so they created NeuroFlow.
Our Approach
We pride ourselves on partnering with healthcare leaders to assist in driving better outcomes, lowering total cost of care, and making behavioral health risk more predictable and transparent. NeuroFlow exists to make sure no one who needs behavioral health support falls through the cracks.
We build more than just engaging digital health tools for self-care: we create platforms that identify population behavioral health risk early, engage individuals with acuity-specific resources, and enable care teams to make smarter and more efficient decisions. Together, NeuroFlow’s solutions arm healthcare organizations with the insights they need to overcome the systemic challenges in today’s healthcare ecosystem.

About us Meet HealthVerity
We’re advancing the science by synchronizing transformational technologies with the nation’s largest healthcare and consumer data ecosystem
Request Demo Our mission
To power a high-governance, privacy-compliant way for our partners to synchronize and exchange real-world data across the broadest ecosystem, enabling longitudinal patient journeys, frictionless access to data and better patient outcomes.
Our story
HealthVerity was started because the healthcare industry needed a more accurate and reliable way to combine disparate datasets (in a HIPAA-compliant manner) to reveal patient insights and power innovation. As we set out to solve these challenges, the vision for what could be accomplished with our comprehensive data ecosystem and ever-evolving technologies became something much greater than a solution to data interoperability.
Today, HealthVerity partners with top pharma , payers and government agencies to synchronize Identity , Privacy , Governance and Exchange through the IPGE approach and advance the science.
