Following Aug 13, 2024, 09:48am EDT Updated Aug 21, 2024, 09:10am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Accenture consultants work in the Chicago office overlooking the city's skyline Brian Cassella/Tribune News Service via Getty Images
It’s often been said that the only constant in life—and in business—is change. And while this can be unsettling for companies, change has consistently led to growth for the management consulting industry. Whether companies are seeking to downsize, expand, rebrand or enhance AI capabilities, businesses often need help from external advisors, particularly those with highly technical skills or niche expertise. As a result, consultants have never been busier.
Alicia Pittman, managing director, senior partner and global people chair at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), says that many businesses coming out of turbulent times post pandemic are seeking large-scale change. “A lot of clients are looking soup to nuts, and asking, ‘How do we accelerate this company to the next chapter?’”
The answer, according to Pittman, is to join forces with the right consulting team. In the case of BCG, when their consultants take on a project, they don’t just drop in, make some fixes and leave. Rather, the consultants take time listening to the needs of their clients, customizing strategies together, and guiding executives and staff on how to implement them. BCG’s philosophy, says Pittman: “We don’t work on clients, we work with clients.”
This approach has apparently served BCG well; for the third straight year it ranked as one of the most recommended firms in our list of the World’s Best Management Consulting Firms . The ranking, created in partnership with market research firm Statista , is based on three national surveys of consultants (partners and managers at consulting firms) and clients (executives) in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany; as well as a global survey of 8,500 consultants and clients in 29 countries across all continents.
Survey respondents were asked which consulting firms they would recommend within 13 industries (such as construction and healthcare) and 14 functional areas (such as digital transformation and organization management), for a total of 27 categories; those with the most recommendations were included in our list and awarded a star rating. Firms in the top 10% (very frequently recommended) received 5 stars, firms between the top 10% and 40% (frequently recommended) received 4 stars, and all others with a sufficient number of recommendations received 3 stars.
In addition to the consulting firms, survey respondents were also able to recommend consulting networks, which aggregate large numbers of independent consultants and facilitate their connection with potential clients. Consulting networks were rated using the same method used to rate consulting firms.
Ultimately, a total of 223 management consulting firms and nine consulting networks made this third annual list. (For more on the methodology, see below.)
Eight firms on our list earned stars in all 27 categories, and they were the same top performers as last year. But this year, Accenture led that pack—bumping McKinsey & Company from the head of the list—with Accenture receiving 26 5-star ratings and one 4-star rating, while McKinsey received 24 5-star ratings and three 4-star ratings. For the second year in a row, Deloitte earned 25 5-star ratings and two 4-star ratings. The other five firms that received stars in all 27 categories (specifically, 4- and 5-star ratings) were Boston Consulting Group (BCG) , Bain & Company , KPMG , PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and EY .
One of the top priorities for clients across every industry this year, says Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of Accenture Strategy, is to reinvent their organization’s generative AI, “impacting everyone from the C-suite to frontline workers.” To do this, Accenture teams advise companies on “building a digital core, transforming processes end to end, rethinking talent strategies, embedding responsible AI principles, and developing change management capabilities,” he says.

Another major focus for businesses around the world is sustainability, says Tamzen Isacsson, CEO of the Management Consultancies Association , a trade organization in the UK. Thus, consulting firms are not only guiding clients on sustainable strategies for their businesses, the consultants themselves are also walking the (carbon-free) walk. “The consulting industry previously had a big carbon footprint in terms of travel,” says Isacsson. Post pandemic, however, consultants have radically revamped the way they work with clients, often traveling much less and instead offering a blend of remote time and face-to-face time.
New norms for remote and digital work arrangements have also made it easier for businesses to work with expert consultants in any country—and there are a growing number of consulting networks facilitating these connections. One such network, Malt —which received high marks in our rankings—has built an online community of more than 700,000 freelance consultants and more than 70,000 clients. The AI-powered platform serves as a matchmaker of sorts, allowing consultants to find projects that suit their skills and interests while offering clients the ability to find consultants with the specific expertise needed.
Malt , which operates in eight countries in Europe and the United Arab Emirates, vets the freelancers, makes sure they are compliant with tax regulations and certified to work where the client is located, and provides tools that help both consultants and clients find matches. Pascal Schäfer, Malt’s head of freelance community and project partnering, says that clients usually come to the platform knowing exactly what they are looking for, and it’s often a consultant with very specific expertise that most companies would not employ on staff. “We can help them to find someone with exactly that skillset or that combination of experience in the country they need,” he says.
“The platform suggests potential candidates based on their experience and hard skills but then we add the human touch,” says Schäfer, noting that Malt proposes three to five candidates to the client—also considering interpersonal skills and price—and the client can choose which candidates they’d like to meet. Malt arranges a call for both parties to talk on their own or with a Malt advisor. When a match is made, clients then hire and pay the consultant through the platform, providing security and stability for all involved.

Methodology
The World’s Best Consulting Firms 2024, created in partnership with market research firm Statista , is based on three national surveys of consultants (partners and managers at consulting firms) and clients (executives) in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany; as well as a global survey of 8,500 consultants and clients in 29 countries across all continents. Survey respondents were asked which consulting firms they would recommend; firms were eligible if they had active offices in at least three of the following regions: Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, Europe, the Middle East, North America and South America.
The firms were recommended within 13 industries (such as technology, financial services and healthcare) and 14 functional areas (such as M&A, marketing and sustainability); those with the most recommendations were included in our list and awarded a star rating. Firms in the top 10% (very frequently recommended) received 5 stars, firms between the top 10% and 40% (frequently recommended) received 4 stars, and all others with a sufficient number of recommendations received 3 stars.
In addition to the consulting firms, survey respondents were also able to recommend consulting networks, which aggregate large numbers of independent consultants and facilitate their connection with potential clients. The networks enable consultants to match with projects that suit their skills and interests, while affording clients the ability to match with consultants offering the specific expertise needed. For this list, the method used to rate consulting firms was also used to rate consulting networks.
Ultimately, a total of 223 management consulting firms and nine consulting networks made the list.

Using Demographics for Audience Profiling
Lauren Oliver
on
January 18, 2023 (Updated: May 4, 2023)
As your brand grows, your audience expands along with you. While generating more customers is great, it can also make your marketing campaigns too broad if you don’t adapt them. Using demographics for audience profiling overcomes this and helps you create highly personalized marketing campaigns that capture your customers’ attention. Today, we’re diving into everything you need to know about using demographics for audience profiling with topics like:
What Is Audience Profiling?
Importance of Demographics for Audience Profiling
Audience Demographics vs Audience Analysis
How To Use Demographics for Audience Profiling
What Is Audience Profiling?
Audience profiling helps you define who your target customers are by looking at different characteristics, including  demographics and psychographics . So instead of treating marketing to a single group, audience profiling looks at your audience in groups based on similar online behaviors.
When developing audience profiles, you’ll gather a mix of data that shows you what users are doing when engaging with your brand. And demographics are one of the first places to start when building your audience profiles. Using demographics for audience profiling allows you to pinpoint the most valuable groups for your content marketing efforts.

Importance of Demographics for Audience Profiling
Demographics give you an easy way to build up different audience profiles. At the most fundamental level, we all fit into a range of demographic categories. These traits—like age, gender, location, and income—all help to give companies an idea of who we are.
The bottom line is that you’re not likely to find an audience profile that doesn’t include this info in some way. Overall, using demographics for profiling can help your team understand your audience better, leading to more effective and personalized content marketing campaigns. And this is just one advantage of several:
More Effective Segmentation
Marketing is more global than ever, which means that your customers can come from all sorts of locations, backgrounds, and cultures. But using a homogenous marketing strategy for all of these people won’t get your business anywhere, which is why it’s important to narrow down your target audience into specific groups.
This is where your team should start with demographics. The data provides a range of categories that your customers either do or don’t fit into. Some companies may use one core demographic as their defining factor. For example, they could market to people based on age as a single factor. In this case, these companies might market to the following age categories:
18 to 24
25 to 30
31 to 35
36 to 40
Over 40
While not every single person within these age categories will have the same preferences and buying habits, it’s an effective starting point. As your team gathers more information about your target customer base, you can build off of the individual demographics and create subcategories with psychographic influencers.
Related reading:  Audience Profile vs Audience Segmentation: Are They Different?
Easier To Identify Target Audiences
When you split your customers into smaller categories, you might see trends specific to each group. For example, maybe you have a lot of customers based in North America between 25 and 30 years old. Or maybe your team notices geographic trends in customers who engage with a certain part of your business. Using demographics in this way makes it much easier to start identifying your most valuable groups.
Once you’ve identified the most ideal target groups, you can make sure to tailor future marketing campaigns to these segments. And more effective campaigns mean a higher chance of boosting conversions and your content marketing ROI.
More Personalized Campaigns
Using demographics, you can easily split people up into smaller groups. From there, you’ve narrowed the playing field to focus on highly-personalized marketing campaigns. In fact, a  McKinsey study  showed that personalized content delivers between five and eight times the ROI than broad campaigns—and can even lift sales by 10% or more.
This highlights the importance of using demographics for audience profiling to create your marketing content. But to make these personalized campaigns, you need to segment your target audience into unique groups that directly benefit from what your brand offers.
Improved Customer Loyalty
Customer loyalty is difficult to gain and easy to lose. However, you can boost customer loyalty by using demographics to better understand your audience’s needs. Crafting messages based on demographics showcases exactly how your brand fulfills customers’ needs. While people aren’t going to trust your business instantly, building your content campaigns using these demographics can help you better address customer pain points, giving your business a better chance of  converting readers to loyal customers .
Demographics for Audience Profiling vs Audience Analysis
It’s easy to confuse audience profiling and audience analysis. While they use similar methods, marketers use these tools in different situations, which deliver different results.
Audience profile:  Profiles use demographic, psychographic, and behavioral information to identify who makes up your audience. It gives you a comprehensive overview of the entire audience, including demographic distributions, needs, values, and attributes.
Audience analysis:  These use demographics and psychographic or situational information to break down an audience into smaller groups. An audience profile highlights clearly defined audience segments.
Both of these methods are effective for digging into your audience data. However, audience analysis is a more general overview, while audience profiling involves actually splitting the audience into groups. In most cases, you’ll run an audience analysis before building your audience profiles with the demographics.
How To Use Demographics for Audience Profiling
When  creating audience profiles , you always want to start with demographics. While  psychographics  comes later, gathering this information about your customers makes the first step much easier. Here’s a general process your team can follow to use demographics for audience profiles:
1. Collect the Data
Collect the demographic information you need to build your profiles, first. You may already have a centralized database of customer information that you can turn to, but if you’re not sure where to begin, there are a few places you can start to collect customer data, including:
Website Analytics
Your website is a treasure trove of customer information. You can farm both demographic and psychographic data from your website, making this a go-to location when you’re looking for data. While you may have a personalized system or tool for monitoring analytics,  Google Analytics and Google Search Console  are both highly effective for gathering these insights.
As you collect data over time, you’ll be able to see a range of analytics from your site, including general metrics like total clicks, session length, and time spent on the page. While these metrics are important to an overall content marketing campaign, they’re not the insights your team needs for audience profiling. Instead, you’ll want the demographic data—ages, locations, income levels, genders—as well as the devices customers use to access your site.
Social Media Analytics
If you have a business account on social, you’ll have access to demographic data at the click of a button through your  social media dashboards . On Instagram, for example, you can access the ages, genders, locations, and activity timeframes of your brand’s followers. While this type of info isn’t as in-depth as the data you collect from your website, social still makes an effective tool for getting an idea of your audience demographics.
It’s crucial you’re collecting demographic data across all of the social media sites your brand is active on. Then, organize it into a social audience or treat each platform differently. However, looking at each platform separately results in better personalization. After all, your LinkedIn audience might be slightly different from your audience on TikTok.
Sales Insights
Your sales team also has customer data you can use for audience profiling. Although much of this type of data is collected manually, the personal interactions and feedback they have with customers give you valuable zero-party data. This zero-party data is information that your customers provide directly to your business. So in a sales call, for instance, customers typically share information about themselves, their business needs, locations, and other demographic data.
Audience Insights
Similar to asking your team, you can increase the amount of demographic data you have by asking the audience. This strategy works especially well for audiences that already show loyalty to your business. For example, readers who’ve signed up for an email newsletter have already freely given you information, so they may be inclined to give a little more. Reach out to your email mailing list with a demographic survey or create polls on social to grab attention, encourage engagement, and learn more about your target audience.
2. Organize Data in One Location
Across these four methods, you should now have a range of customer data at your fingertips. From there, we need to make sure that it is as accessible as possible. If your data is split between many different locations, you’re creating what is known as a data silo structure. This is where data is inaccessible to everyone in your business, as it’s fragmented across many platforms.
To get around this, you should make sure you have a centralized CRM platform. Many of the leading  CRMs  have integrations that can pull data from all of the above methods. When using your platform, collect all of your data in one place to make it more accessible when building your audience profiles.
3. Start Segmenting
Moving through your demographics, group people based on shared factors. Depending on your company and what products or services you offer, it might make sense to define your audience profiles based on any number of features. For example, you could:
Segment based on age:  Age is normally the first place to look when using demographic data. While useful and potentially informative, don’t put all your eggs in this basket.
Segment according to income:  Income can radically influence the types of products customers look for, compare, and purchase. This is a good place to start with demographic segmentation, depending on your business offering.
Segment by family status:  Demographic data that shows a customer is married or has children can make different products attractive to them when compared to an individual.
These are just three ways to use demographic data for audience profiling. Ultimately, the way your team approaches grouping your customers depends on the goals and unique value propositions of your brand.
4. Create Profiles Specific To Each Segment
You have your segments grouped, with demographics leading the way. Now what? It’s important to create profiles for each unique segment. For example, one of your defined segments might include people who are between 35 and 40 years old, married with no kids, and earn an average income of $250,000 per year.
While this might only be a small portion of your audience, they would be ideal candidates for higher-cost products and services. With this insight, you can create a marketing campaign that follows tiered pricing or accommodates higher-income customers.
You might also compare social media demographics to determine which marketing channel is the most effective for each of your audience segments. By crafting a personalized message for each of your demographic audience profiles, you create a campaign that has a higher chance of converting customers and boosting loyalty and retention.

5. Measure and Adapt
No marketing campaign is complete without measuring performance and success. It’s important you continue to monitor and collect data on the success of your marketing campaigns within each specific audience. Several metrics that can help your team measure and adapt your audience profiles include engagement with specific topics, conversions with certain content types, and positive feedback on social. Using this data, continue to refine your messaging over time. While this can be a long process, accommodating each audience profile results in better, more high-quality marketing materials.
Demographic data is one of the fundamental pillars of an effective audience profile. And in content marketing, personalized campaigns lead to increased conversions, engagement, and revenue.
