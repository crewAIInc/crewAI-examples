Methodology
The Snowflake Data Trends Report 2024 is generated from fully aggregated, anonymized data detailing usage of the Snowflake Data Cloud and its integrated features and tools. In this report, we examine patterns and trends in data and AI adoption across more than 9,000 global Snowflake accounts. The Snowflake Data Cloud provides insight into the state of data and AI, including which technologies are the fastest growing. Note that usage attributable to internal consumption, if any, has been removed and is not reflected in any of the metrics contained herein. The accounts and usage reflected in this report represent every major industry and include both longtime Snowflake users and others who only recently joined the Data Cloud.
Except where noted in the text, the data in this report compares monthly averages from January 2024 (represented as ‚Äúthis year‚Äù) to averages in January 2023 (‚Äúlast year‚Äù). When compared, this is depicted as ‚Äúyear over year‚Äù growth to align with Snowflake‚Äôs fiscal year end, though the figures themselves are only representative of January figures to calculate growth.
When possible, we have provided these year-over-year comparisons to showcase growth trends over time. Where data was drawn from Snowflake features that became publicly available after the start of the fiscal year, data was collected and compared as of the first full month after which the feature became available in public preview, and that date is noted in the text. Notably, growth figures for features moving into public preview are expected to be considerably higher, as private previews are limited in scope and necessarily restricted to select Snowflake customers.

Snowflake Competitors: 16 Alternatives Worth Exploring (2024)
Snowflake is one of the top cloud data warehousing platforms out there. It gives you a managed service to store, process, and analyze massive datasets. What really sets it apart is its unique hybrid structure , which blends shared-disk and shared-nothing architecture. This makes scaling easy and allows it to handle high-performance data with ease. Snowflake was founded in July 2012 by Benoit Dageville , Thierry Cruanes , and Marcin Zukowski . Their mission was to tackle a big data problem: making cloud data storage and computing easy to use and scalable, so users wouldn't get bogged down by traditional warehouse systems. Snowflake has some cutting-edge features. These include automatic scaling , secure data sharing , zero-copy cloning , time-travel capabilities , minimal maintenance overhead and strong security and governance features . Another big plus is its flexible architecture that decouples compute from storage, offering flexibility and cost efficiency. What's more, Snowflake works well with both structured and semi-structured data out of the box. And, it integrates seamlessly with AWS , Azure , and Google Cloud , which makes it a top choice. According to DB-Engines , Snowflake is now number 7th in the rankings (as of October 2024), with a score of 140.60 , showing how quickly it's risen to the top player in data warehousing. The industry has taken notice, and Snowflake is cementing its reputation as a market leader. Snowflake DB-Engine Ranking (Source: db-engines ) - Snowflake Alternatives But Snowflake is up against stiff competition. There are a lot of other options out there that offer similar features and performance, all contending for the top spot. In this article, we will explore 16 top competitors‚Äîanalyzing their architecture, features, performance, pricing, and use cases‚Äîto provide a comprehensive comparison of how they measure up against Snowflake.

Intro To Databricks - What Is Databricks Databricks Architecture Databricks architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate with major cloud providers such as AWS , Azure , and Google Cloud . This versatility allows it to provide an optimized environment for data engineering, machine learning, and analytics at scale. Databricks adopts a Lakehouse Architecture, which blends the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses. The platform offers a hybrid Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, consisting of two key components‚Äîthe Control Plane and the Compute Plane‚Äîboth of which are crucial for the platform's scalability, management, and performance optimization. Databricks Architecture (Source: Databricks ) - Snowflake Competitors - Databricks vs Snowflake a) Control Plane Control Plane is fully managed by Databricks and includes backend services, such as the web application, REST APIs for account management, and workspace administration. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for users to interact with notebooks , jobs , and clusters . This layer handles user authentication and metadata management, ensuring secure access and governance across the platform. All operations within the control plane, including metadata management (cluster states, job configurations, and table schemas), are hosted and governed by Databricks. b) Compute Plane Compute Plane is where the actual data processing takes place. The platform provides two types of compute environments, offering flexibility depending on security, control, and performance requirements: Serverless Compute Plane : A fully managed environment where Databricks automatically handles resource provisioning and scaling. Classic Compute Plane :¬† In this setup, compute resources run within the user's cloud account (e.g., AWS or Azure), providing greater control over networking and security policies. c) Storage Layer Databricks integrates with cloud-based storage solutions for data persistence. Each workspace has an associated storage bucket (e.g., Amazon S3 for AWS or Azure Blob Storage) that holds system data, notebooks, job details, and logs. This storage layer supports the Databricks File System (DBFS) , enabling efficient data access and management. Check out the video below for a deeper dive into Databricks architecture. Tutorial - Databricks Platform Architecture - Snowflake Alternatives - Snowflake Competitors Here are some key features of Databricks: 1) Databricks brings together the best of both worlds‚Äî data lakes and data warehouses ‚Äîin one platform where you can store, process, and analyze your data. 2) Databricks integrates deeply with Apache Spark , enabling distributed data processing at scale using familiar languages like SQL , Python , Scala , and R . It is optimized for large-scale data processing and analytics‚Äã. 3)Databricks enhances data reliability with Delta Lake , which supports ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and efficient data versioning for consistent data pipelines‚Äã. 4) Databricks offers seamless integration with MLflow , providing comprehensive lifecycle management for machine learning models, including experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment‚Äã. 5) Databricks supports SQL-based analytics with optimized execution, enabling users to run ad-hoc queries and create interactive dashboards for real-time insights. 6) Databricks enables secure, real-time data sharing across various platforms with Delta Sharing , allowing collaboration without data replication. 7) Databricks provides centralized governance through Unity Catalog ensures fine-grained access control across all data assets, enhancing data security and regulatory compliance‚Äã. 8) Databricks simplifies incremental data loading from cloud object storage with Auto Loader , a scalable tool for efficiently managing streaming data pipelines. 9) Databricks provides libraries and tools to build, train, and deploy ML models at scale. ‚Ä¶ and so much more ! Pros and Cons of Databricks Pros of Databricks: Easily handles small to large datasets effortlessly. Leverages Apache Spark for quick data analysis. Simplifies data pipeline creation and management. Supports real-time teamwork with shared notebooks. Provides comprehensive tools for the machine learning lifecycle. Very strong access controls and encryption features. Consumption-based pricing model. Compatible with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Strong support for machine learning and AI workloads. Cons of Databricks: More complex setup compared to Snowflake. Requires expertise in Spark for optimal use. Time-consuming initial configuration required. Lacks intuitive dashboard creation tools. Can be expensive for smaller-scale initiatives. Databricks vs Snowflake‚ÄîWhich is the Better Choice? When comparing Databricks and Snowflake, consider their key differences. Think about their architectures, use cases, and performance strengths.

Collecting information about these interactions is the first step in understanding and improving the customer experience and figuring out how to improve it. Some of the data types CDPs work with include: 1. Identity data Identity data is the foundation of your customers‚Äô profile in a CDP. This data type allows you to identify each customer and includes name, demographics (age and gender), location, contact information, social profile, professional information, and account information.¬† 2. Descriptive data Descriptive data expands on identity data and gives you a fuller picture of your customer. The categories of descriptive data will vary based on your business and may include career information (such as income), lifestyle information (such as whether they own a vehicle or have pets), family information, and hobbies and interests.¬† 3. Digital customer experience data Data tracked during the digital customer experience, or behavioral data, allows you to understand how your customer engaged with your brand, whether through certain actions, reactions, or transactions. This data includes Transactional data , to help you understand your customers‚Äô purchase history Site traffic , to give you an understanding of how your customer interacts with your website¬† Marketing email engagement , such as email opens, link clicks, and unsubscribes Social media activity , including information about how customers engage with your social channels such as Facebook and Twitter¬† Customer support interactions , for information about what customers think and feel about your products and services¬† 4. Qualitative Data Qualitative data provides context for customer profiles and includes your customers‚Äô motivations, opinions, and attitudes about your brand. It could consist of answers to questions such as, ‚ÄúHow did you hear about us?‚Äù and, ‚ÄúHow likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?‚Äù Customer Data Platform Requirements The data infrastructure needed to support a good CDP includes Data Management Platforms (DMPs), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Cloud Data Platform. Data Management Platforms ¬†(DMPs)¬† to target ads to anonymous customer segments more effectively. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)¬† for referring information to a database¬† marketing team ¬†that uses email and other channels to market to known customers. Cloud Data Platform , a big data platform¬† to provide secure access to all data, enable teams to work on standard data sets without resource contention or performance degradation, and support multiple workloads.¬† Snowflake and Customer Data Platforms Snowflake's cross-cloud platform¬† enables CDP ¬†(Customer Data Platform) users to discover, instantly share, collaborate, and quickly derive value from the data.¬† You can build your CDP on top of a cloud data platform, or you can buy an out-of-the-box CDP from providers such as Segment, Simon, and AgilOne.
