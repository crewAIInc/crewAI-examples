## 3. Study Strategies

For each topic, apply the following strategies:

*   **Active Recall:** Test yourself frequently.
*   **Spaced Repetition:** Review material at increasing intervals.
*   **Practice Problems:** Work through a variety of problems.
*   **Interleaving:** Mix up the order of topics you study.
*   **Explain it to someone:**  Teaching solidifies your understanding.
