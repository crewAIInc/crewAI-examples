# DSA Exam Study Plan

## 1. Exam Overview

**Subject:** DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)
**Exam Date:** In 3 days (specific date should be added here)
**Topics Covered:**  This study plan covers fundamental DSA topics including Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Searching and Sorting Algorithms, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Backtracking.

## 2. Study Schedule

### Day 1: Foundational Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Morning:** Review basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly), Stacks, Queues. Practice basic operations and implementation in your preferred programming language.
*   **Afternoon:** Study basic algorithms: Searching (Linear, Binary), Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Selection), Recursion. Implement these algorithms and analyze their time and space complexity.
*   **Evening:** Solve coding problems related to arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching, and sorting on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars. Focus on understanding the concepts and applying them practically.

### Day 2: Trees and Graphs

*   **Morning:** Study Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder). Implement tree operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
*   **Afternoon:** Study Graphs: Graph representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List), Graph Traversals (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search). Implement graph algorithms and understand their applications.
*   **Evening:** Solve coding problems related to trees and graphs. Focus on applying different traversal algorithms and understanding their complexities.

### Day 3: Advanced Algorithms and Revision

*   **Morning:** Study advanced algorithms: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking. Understand the core concepts and practice implementing basic dynamic programming problems.
*   **Afternoon:** Revise all the topics covered in the previous two days. Focus on areas where you feel less confident. Review key concepts, algorithms, and data structures.
*   **Evening:** Solve mixed coding problems covering various DSA topics. Practice time management and problem-solving skills under pressure.  Take a practice exam or timed coding challenge to simulate exam conditions.  Review any remaining weak areas one final time.


## 3. Study Strategies

* **Active Recall:** After studying a topic, try to recall the key concepts without looking at your notes.
* **Spaced Repetition:** Review topics at increasing intervals to reinforce your memory.
* **Practice Problems:** Solve a variety of coding problems to apply your knowledge and identify weak areas.
* **Code Implementation:** Implement data structures and algorithms in your preferred programming language.
* **Time Management:** Practice solving problems under timed conditions to simulate exam pressure.
