# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Exam Study Plan

**Exam Date:** May 30th (Assuming preparation starts on May 23rd)

## 1. Exam Overview

**Subject:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Date:** May 30th

**Topics:** This study plan covers core OOP concepts, including:

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Data Hiding
* Constructors and Destructors (language-specific)

## 2. Study Schedule

This schedule utilizes a spaced repetition approach and emphasizes active learning.

| Day | Date       | Topics                                     |
| --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | May 23rd   | Classes & Objects, Encapsulation           |
| 2   | May 24th   | Inheritance                               |
| 3   | May 25th   | Polymorphism                             |
| 4   | May 26th   | Abstraction & Data Hiding                  |
| 5   | May 27th   | Constructors & Destructors (if applicable) |
| 6   | May 28th   | Review & Practice                           |
| 7   | May 29th   | Final Review & Rest                         |


**Daily Breakdown:** (See detailed breakdown in the previous response for specific activities and coding examples)

## 3. Study Strategies

* **Active Recall:** Test yourself regularly.
* **Spaced Repetition:** Review material at increasing intervals.
* **Hands-on Coding:** Practice implementing OOP concepts in code.
* **Visual Aids:** Use diagrams like UML class diagrams.
* **Seek Clarification:** Ask for help when needed.


## 4. Learning Resources

**Recommended YouTube Search Terms & Channels:** (See previous response for a more detailed breakdown of suggested searches for each topic.)

General OOP:

* Search: "Object Oriented Programming explained"
* Channels: freeCodeCamp.org, CS Dojo, The Net Ninja

Language-Specific Resources:

* Search: "[OOP Concept] in [Your Programming Language]" (e.g., "Inheritance in Java")

**Finding Quality Videos:**

* Check upload dates for recency.
* Look for language-specific tutorials.
* Read comments for community feedback.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Suppose you are learning Java.  A good search might be: "Inheritance in Java explained." This is more targeted than a generic "Inheritance" search.

**Key Reminder:**  This study plan provides a framework. Adapt it to your learning style and course requirements. The most effective way to learn OOP is by actively writing and experimenting with code.  Good luck!
