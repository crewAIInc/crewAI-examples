# AI Crew - Code Generation Crew
## Introduction
This project is an example using the CrewAI framework to run agents that generate code, run it, and report the results. The Agent with `enable_code_execution=True` will be responsible for creating the code based on the tasks goal. The code will be executed and then the output will be passed to the reporting analyst.

## CrewAI Framework
CrewAI is designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-playing AI agents. In this example, these agents work together to give a complete stock analysis and investment recommendation.

## Requirements

Docker is required to run the script. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Running the Script
- **Configure Environment**: Copy ``.env.example` and set up the environment variables for OpenAI.
- **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Execute the Script**: Run `python main.py` and input your idea on the tasks.

## Details & Explanation
- **Running the Script**: Execute `python main.py`` and the crew will kickoff bringing the last 30 days of stocks from APPL and NVDA but the use-case here is to show-up the Code Intepreter ability of the Anget.

The logic will take advantage of the structure that CrewAI provides, so that the agent can create the code and execute it.
After executing the code created by the agent himself, if for some reason it was not correct, the output was passed on to the same agent so that he can correct the code and run it again, after being executed correctly and the output will be passed on to the report analyst.


- **Key Components**:
  - `./main.py`: Main script file.
  - `./tasks.py`: Main file with the tasks prompts.
  - `./agents.py`: Main file with the agents creation.


## Example

In the example below, the agent created the code to fetch the last 30 days of stock prices for APPL and NVDA, run it, and printed the results so it can be sent to the reporting analyst.

```bash
Action: Code Interpreter
Action Input: {"code": "import yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the time range\nend_date = datetime.now()\nstart_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)\n\n# Fetch stock data\nappl_data = yf.download('AAPL', start=start_date, end=end_date)\nnvda_data = yf.download('NVDA', start=start_date, end=end_date)\n\n# Get the last 30 days of stock prices\nappl_prices = appl_data['Close']\nnvda_prices = nvda_data['Close']\n\n# Print the stock prices\nprint('APPL Stock Prices (Last 30 Days):')\nprint(appl_prices)\nprint('\\nNVDA Stock Prices (Last 30 Days):')\nprint(nvda_prices)", "dependencies_used_in_code": ["yfinance", "pandas"]}
